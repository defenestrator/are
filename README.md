The investment we make in ourselves

## What even is this?

This is a Twitch app built with Laravel

### I totally stole it from

https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/topshelf-fm

@ThePrimeagen and @teej_dv and Taylor Otwell built a little twitch app on stream one day, using Laravel, for asking questions of Top Shelf guests, and I'm repurposing to fulfill my own twisted desires at https://twitch.tv/jeremyboise

This project has no affiliation with, nor is it endorsed by Laravel, or anyone else, especially me.

#### Do not use this code if you:

- value your own time
- have any self-respect
- are comfortable speaking on stage
- genuinely enjoy kale
- can change a tire
